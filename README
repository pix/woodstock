  Woodstock is designed to aid the taks of a sysadmin by providing a log of
  line read by readline. Woodstock is  completely transparent  to the user 
  and applications it hooks in as a library providing a wrapper around calls
  to readline() calls. Logging is done via syslogd and written to user
  allowing offsite logging of activity, generally the user is
  stored as /var/log/user.log.


U S A G E

  Woodstock is  able to log all  users or just root,  this functionality is
  configured at compile through the woodstock.h header, #define ROOT_ONLY 1
  will restrict logging to root activities. Installation is as follows: 

     make
     make install

  Woodstock is placed in /etc/ld.so.preload to trap all occurances of exec,
  if you wish to monitor only certain applications you can do so through
  the $LD_PRELOAD environment variable - simply set it to /lib/woodstock.so
  before loading the application. For example:

     export LD_PRELOAD=/lib/woodstock.so
     lynx http://linux.com/
     unset LD_PRELOAD 

  To remove woodstock later, simply edit /etc/ld.so.preload and remove the
  reference to woodstock.so and delete /lib/woodstock.so.
